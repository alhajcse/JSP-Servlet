There is no executable permissions for the .sh files.


# Make the file executable
You just need to give a chmod here and then   +x. +x is going to make this file executable and what are the files we want to make executable we want to make all .sh files   so just give *.sh.

chmod +x *.sh

# Start the Tomcat by startup.sh

then sudo ./startup.sh

Now how to check whether Tomcat that is properly started or not Iâ€™m going to go to my browser and in here I will just write http://localhost:8080. The port 8080 is the default port for the Tomcat to start.
